#Hi I'm Your Guide

Here's a list of the non-technical TODO:

#Things to Track:

## Overall Metrics
 * pH
 * water level
 * nutrition
    * still not sure how accurate this is
 * dissolved oxygen content

## Per Plant Metrics
 * Average Light
 * Visual plant health

## System
 * Water Pump Status
 * all the stuff from overall metrics

##Operations
 * Add new plant
   * set pH, nutrition, day/night periods
     * warn if incompatible w/ other plants in circuit
 * Remove Plant
 * Add new Circuit
   * mng equipment tracking
 * Remove Circuit
 * Manage Circuit Else-how

##View
### Constant Display
 * view alerts
 * view critical circuit/plant statuses
### Collection View:
 * navigate circuits
   * explore options, current idea is list-style ala Komodo
### Unit View
 * View overall sys metrics
 * See crit alerts in detail
 * navigate plants
 * selecting a plant activates plant visual view
### Plant View
 * visually look at the plant through a camera
 * see plant health metrics
 * see plant age, growth in comparison to expected, etc.
